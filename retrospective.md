# Retrospective

A retrospective, sometimes called a 'retro', is a regular meeting where the whole team talks about what's going well and what isn't.

It gives us the power and responsibility to:

* change what's not working for us
* take ownership of the way we work

We do a retro at the end of a chunk of work (a sprint or a project). However, the content of the retro doesn't have to directly relate to the work done.

We allow 60 to 90 minutes for the meeting.

Retrospectives are the single part of agile that absolutely must happen. They are our most effective tool for improving our way of working.

## The format of a retrospective

There are [many](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans) different ways to run a retrospective. It can be helpful to mix it up a bit. Bring a suggestion of an alternative style if you would like to try it. It is ultimately the team's decision what style is chosen, though.

So long as there is a time boxed part of the meeting to share:

* What went well
* What did not go well

And these are documented.
