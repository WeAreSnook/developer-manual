# Issues

We use [GitHub's issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

When creating a new issue, you should:

* create it in the appropriate repo

If known at the time, you can also assign the appropriate people to the issue.

## How we write our issues

An issue is considered ready to be actioned when it has:

### a user story / job story

A user story would normally take the following format:

```
As a {persona}
I want {what}
So that {why}
```

A key thing to remember is to base the user stories on real users and their needs.

Another option is to use a job story. The advantage of this is that it focuses on the causality, anxieties, and motivations of the user, e.g. why they are doing what they’re doing. It’s still based on research into real users.

The format for a Job Story is:

```
When {situation} 
I want to {motivation}
so I can {outcome}
```

### acceptance criteria

In order to know (and test) whether a ticket is done it’s really helpful to create acceptance criteria. From a [well-cited article](https://www.seguetech.com/what-characteristics-make-good-agile-acceptance-criteria/) on what makes a good acceptance criteria:

> Acceptance Criteria are a set of statements, each with a clear pass/fail result, that specify both functional (e.g., minimal marketable functionality) and non-functional (e.g., minimal quality) requirements applicable at the current stage of project integration. These requirements represent “conditions of satisfaction.” There is no partial acceptance: either a criterion is met or it is not.

> These criteria define the boundaries and parameters of a User Story/feature and determine when a story is completed and working as expected. They add certainty to what the team is building.

> Acceptance Criteria must be expressed clearly, in simple language the customer would use, just like the User Story, without ambiguity as to what the expected outcome is: what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. They must be testable: easily translated into one or more manual/automated test cases.

These can be listed in a Checklist to allow you to update their status as you work on the ticket.

### relevant links

Any designs, associated tickets, or background reading that would be required in order for someone to be able to understand the appropriate context surrounding the ticket.
