# Deploying to GOV PaaS

[GOV PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) gives public sector teams an approved cloud environment to host applications. It is built on top of the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) platform.

## Prerequisites

- To set up a GOV PaaS account you need a `.gov.uk` email. This email will usually be responsible for managing applications across an orgnanisation. If the organisation doesn't already have a GOV PaaS account, the infrastructure / IT team should be responsible for setting it up.
