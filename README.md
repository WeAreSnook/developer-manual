# developer-manual

We use [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tools and techniques to:

- self-organise and plan
- communicate (within the team and with the rest of the organisation)
- continuously improve the way we work

We follow a loose gathering of agile processes:

- [standups](agile/standup.md)
- [retrospectives](agile/retrospective.md)
- [show and tells](agile/show_and_tell.md)

We can and should change any aspect of these lightweight processes through retrospectives.

## Contributing code

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to collaborate when writing code that can be in the open. We use [Gitlab](http://code.snook) to collaborate on code that needs to be behind a VPN.

We follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), while expanding on:

- [Branches](workflow/branches.md)
- [Commits](workflow/commits.md)
- [Issues](workflow/issues.md)
- [Milestones](workflow/milestones.md)
- [Pull requests](workflow/pull-requests.md)
- [Repositories](workflow/repositories.md)

## Deploying code

We use:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static sites
- [Heroku](deploying/heroku.md) for sites with a backend code requirement

Ask a member of the team if you need access to these services.

## Tools and methodologies

Within the digital team we use the following:

- [tools](tools.md)
- [methodologies](methodologies.md)

## Removing access

When someone leaves the team, [we remove their access to the tools we use](offboarding/removing_access.md).
